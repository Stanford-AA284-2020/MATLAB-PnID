%% Gas tank blowdown simulation

% Tank Blowdown Method used in:
%   Haque et al., Rapid depressurization of pressure vessels, J. Loss Prev.
%       Process Ind., Vol 3, January 1990
% - Select Pressure Decrement
% - Perform isentropic flash on each zone
% - Calculate rate of discharge through choke
% - Calculate time step duration
% - Calculate fluid mass discharged
% - Calculate heat transfer coefficients for each zone
% - Perform energy and mass balances over contents of each zone and energy
%   balance over vessel wall
% - If depressurization is complete, stop; otherwise repeat

% Method here:
% - Specify initial static pressure

% - Calculate rate of discharge through orifice with static pressure
% - Calculate pressure drop through valve, tubing, and regulator
% - Calculate adiabatic temp change of gas due to pressure drop
% - Recalculate rate of discharge with pressure drop
% - Repeat until pressure drops & orifice mass flow match

% - Specify time step & Calculate fluid mass discharged
% - Perform isentropic expansion of gas in cylinder to find
% - Repeat until P = Pa
